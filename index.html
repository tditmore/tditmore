### About Me

<img style="float: left;" src="">
I am a PhD candidate in political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I previously received my MA in political science from UNC in 2020 and a BA in international studies from Pepperdine University. 

I specialize in international political economy, with a particular focus on international taxation. My research examines new forms of tax cooperation from systemic, state, and individual perspectives. I also study other forms of international fiscal politics, including the behavior of sovereign wealth funds.
