### About Me


<div style="display: flex; align-items: center;">
  <div style="flex: 1; padding-right: 1in;">
    <p>I am a PhD candidate in political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I previously received my MA in political science from UNC in 2020 and a BA in international studies from Pepperdine University. </p>
    <p>I specialize in international political economy, with a particular focus on international taxation. My research examines new forms of tax cooperation from systemic, state, and individual perspectives. I also study other forms of international fiscal politics, including the behavior of sovereign wealth funds.</p>

In my spare time, you may find me trying to keep up with a vivacious two-year old, idling on a couch, reading novels, or desperately trying to stay awake while watching my West Coast sports teams play in Eastern Time.
